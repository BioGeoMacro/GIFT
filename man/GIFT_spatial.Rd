\usage{
GIFT_spatial(
  shp = NULL,
  coordinates = NULL,
  overlap = "centroid_inside",
  entity_ID = NULL,
  GIFT_version = "latest",
  api = "https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/api/extended/"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp}{Shapefile provided by the user. Its Coordinate Reference System
(CRS) must be set to WGS84 (EPSG code 4326).}

\item{coordinates}{Custom set of coordinates. The format is a two columns,
the first one being longitudes and the second being latitudes. If 4
coordinates are given, the function assumes that these are the four corners
of a bounding box.}

\item{overlap}{A character string defining the criteria to use in order to
retrieve checklists. Available options are \code{centroid_inside},
\code{extent_intersect}, \code{shape_intersect} and \code{shape_inside}. For example,
\code{extent_intersect} means that every polygon from GIFT for which the extent
intersects the provided shape/coordinates will be retrieved.}

\item{entity_ID}{List of entity_ID to retrieve.}

\item{GIFT_version}{character string defining the version of the GIFT
database to use. The function retrieves by default the \code{latest} stable
version. If set to \code{beta}, the most up-to-date version which is still
subject to changes and edits is used.}

\item{api}{character string defining from which API the data will be
retrieved.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 3 columns: \emph{entity_ID} the identification
number of a polygon, \emph{geo_entity_ref} its name, and \emph{coverage}
which indicates the percentage of overlap between the provided shape and
the different polygons of GIFT.
}
\description{
Retrieve checklists overlapping with a shape file or a set of coordinates.
