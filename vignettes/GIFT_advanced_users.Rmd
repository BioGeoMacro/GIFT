This vignette documents some functions and specificities that were not
presented in the
[main vignette](https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/articles/GIFT.html) of the
package. It is mainly targeted for advanced users of the GIFT database.

# 1. Versions and metadata for checklists {#section1}

In all the functions from the package, there is a `version` argument. This
argument allows for retrieving different instances of the GIFT database and
therefore make all previous studies using the GIFT database reproducible. For
example, the version used in Weigelt et al. (2020) is `"1.0"`. To get more
information about the content of the different versions, you can go
[here](https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/about) and click on the tab Version Log.

To access all the available versions of the database, you can run the
following function:

```{r}
versions <- GIFT_versions()
kable(versions, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

The column `version` of this table is the one to use when you want to retrieve
past versions of the GIFT database. By default, the argument used is
`GIFT_version = "latest"` which leads to the current latest stable version of
the database ("2.0" in October 2022).

The function `GIFT_lists()` can be run to retrieve metadata about the GIFT
checklists. In the next chunk, we call it with different values for the
`GIFT_version` argument.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
list_latest <- GIFT_lists(GIFT_version = "latest") # default value
list_1 <- GIFT_lists(GIFT_version = "1.0")
```

The number of checklists available was 3122 in the version 1.0 and equals 4475
in the version 2.0.

<br>

# 2. References

When using GIFT database in a research article, it is a good practice to cite
the references used, and list them in an Appendix. The following function
retrieves the reference for each checklist, as well as some metadata.
References are documented in the column `ref_long`.

```{r}
ref <- GIFT_references()
ref <- ref[which(ref$ref_ID %in% c(22, 10333, 10649)),
           c("ref_ID", "ref_long", "geo_entity_ref")]

# 3 first rows of that table
kable(ref, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

<br>

# 3. Checklist data

The main wrapper function to retrieve checklists and their species composition
is `GIFT_checklists()` but you also have the possibility to retrieve individual
checklists using `GIFT_checklists_raw()`. You would need to know the
identification number `list_ID` of the checklists you want to retrieve.
<br>
To quickly see all the `list_ID` available in the database, you can run `GIFT_lists()` as shown in [Section 1](#section1).

<br>
When calling `GIFT_checklists_raw()`, you can set the argument `namesmatched`
to `TRUE` in order to get extra columns informing about the taxonomic
harmonization that was performed when uploading the list to GIFT database.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
listID_1 <- GIFT_checklists_raw(list_ID = c(11926))
listID_1_tax <- GIFT_checklists_raw(list_ID = c(11926), namesmatched = TRUE)

ncol(listID_1) # 16 columns
ncol(listID_1_tax) # 33 columns
length(unique(listID_1$work_ID)); length(unique(listID_1_tax$orig_ID))
```

In the list we called, you can see that we "lost" some species after taxonomic
harmonization as we went from 1331 in the source to 1106 after the taxonomic
harmonization. This means that several species were considered as synonyms or
unknown plant species in the taxonomic backbone used for harmonization.
<br><br>
*Note: the service mainly used to taxonomically harmonize the species' names*
*was The Plant List up to version 2.0 and World checklist of Vascular Plants*
*afterwards.*

<br>

# 4. Spatial subset

In the
[main vignette](https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/articles/GIFT.html), we
illustrated how to retrieve checklists that were falling into a provided
shapefile, using the western Mediterranean basin provided with the GIFT R
package.

```{r}
data("western_mediterranean")
```

We here provide more details on the different values the `overlap` argument
can take, using the function `GIFT_spatial()`. The following figure illustrates
how this argument works:

<br>
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. GIFT spatial", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_spatial.svg")
```
<br>

We now illustrate this by retrieving checklists falling in the western
Mediterranean basin using the four options available.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
med_centroid_inside  <- GIFT_spatial(shp = western_mediterranean,
                                     overlap = "centroid_inside")
med_extent_intersect <- GIFT_spatial(shp = western_mediterranean,
                                     overlap = "extent_intersect")
med_shape_intersect <- GIFT_spatial(shp = western_mediterranean,
                                    overlap = "shape_intersect")
med_shape_inside <- GIFT_spatial(shp = western_mediterranean,
                                 overlap = "shape_inside")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
med_shape_inside <- GIFT_spatial(shp = western_mediterranean,
                                 overlap = "shape_inside")
```


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
length(unique(med_extent_intersect$entity_ID))
length(unique(med_shape_intersect$entity_ID))
length(unique(med_centroid_inside$entity_ID))
length(unique(med_shape_inside$entity_ID))
```

We here see that we progressively lose lists as we apply more selective
criterion on the spatial overlap. The most restrictive option being
`overlap = "shape_inside"` with 72 regions, then
`overlap = "centroid_inside"` with 84 regions,
`overlap = "shape_intersect"` with 104 regions and finally the less
restrictive one being `overlap = "extent_intersect"` with 108 regions.
<br>
Using the functions `GIFT_shapes()` and calling it for the entity_IDs retrieved
in each instance, we can download the shape files for each region.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
geodata_extent_intersect <- GIFT_shapes(med_extent_intersect$entity_ID)

geodata_shape_inside <-
  geodata_extent_intersect[which(geodata_extent_intersect$entity_ID %in%
                                   med_shape_inside$entity_ID), ]
geodata_centroid_inside <-
  geodata_extent_intersect[which(geodata_extent_intersect$entity_ID %in%
                                   med_centroid_inside$entity_ID), ]
geodata_shape_intersect <-
  geodata_extent_intersect[which(geodata_extent_intersect$entity_ID %in%
                                   med_shape_intersect$entity_ID), ]
```

And then make a map.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
par_overlap <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mai = c(0, 0, 0.5, 0))
plot(sf::st_geometry(geodata_shape_inside),
     col = geodata_shape_inside$entity_ID,
     main = paste("shape inside\n",
                  length(unique(med_shape_inside$entity_ID)),
                  "polygons"))
plot(sf::st_geometry(western_mediterranean), lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

plot(sf::st_geometry(geodata_centroid_inside),
     col = geodata_centroid_inside$entity_ID,
     main = paste("centroid inside\n",
                  length(unique(med_centroid_inside$entity_ID)),
                  "polygons"))
points(geodata_centroid_inside$point_x, geodata_centroid_inside$point_y)
plot(sf::st_geometry(western_mediterranean), lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

plot(sf::st_geometry(geodata_shape_intersect),
     col = geodata_shape_intersect$entity_ID,
     main = paste("shape intersect\n",
                  length(unique(med_shape_intersect$entity_ID)),
                  "polygons"))
plot(sf::st_geometry(western_mediterranean), lwd = 2, add = TRUE)

plot(sf::st_geometry(geodata_extent_intersect),
     col = geodata_extent_intersect$entity_ID,
     main = paste("extent intersect\n",
                  length(unique(med_extent_intersect$entity_ID)),
                  "polygons"))
plot(sf::st_geometry(western_mediterranean), lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
par(par_overlap)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "", out.width = "100%",echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/advanced_overlap.png")
```

# 5. Remove overlapping regions

GIFT comprises many polygons and for some regions, there are several polygons
overlapping. How to remove overlapping polygons and the associated parameters
are two things detailed in the
[main vignette](https://biogeomacro.github.io/GIFT/articles/GIFT.html).
We here provide further details:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
med_shape_inside <- data.frame(
  entity_ID = c(145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 414, 415, 416, 417, 547, 548,
                549, 550, 551, 552, 586, 591, 592, 736, 738, 739, 1033, 1036,
                10001, 10034, 10071, 10072, 10104, 10184, 10303, 10422, 10430,
                10751, 10860, 10978, 11028, 11029, 11030, 11031, 11033, 11035,
                11036, 11037, 11038, 11039, 11040, 11041, 11042, 11043, 11044,
                11045, 11046, 11434, 11455, 11461, 11474, 11477, 11503, 12065,
                12071, 12078, 12230, 12231, 12232, 12233, 12551, 12632, 12633,
                12634, 12635))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
length(med_shape_inside$entity_ID)
length(GIFT_no_overlap(med_shape_inside$entity_ID, area_threshold_island = 0,
                       area_threshold_mainland = 100, overlap_threshold = 0.1))

# The following polygons are overlapping:
GIFT_no_overlap(med_shape_inside$entity_ID, area_threshold_island = 0,
                area_threshold_mainland = 100, overlap_threshold = 0.1)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Example of two overlapping polygons: Spain mainland and Andalusia
overlap_shape <- GIFT_shapes(entity_ID = c(10071, 12078))
```


```{r, include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
overlap_shape <- GIFT_shapes(entity_ID = c(10071, 12078))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
par_overlap_shp <- par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(sf::st_geometry(overlap_shape),
     col = c(rgb(red = 1, green = 0, blue = 0, alpha = 0.5),
             rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1, alpha = 0.3)),
     lwd = c(2, 1),
     main = "Overlapping polygons")
par(par_overlap_shp)

GIFT_no_overlap(c(10071, 12078), area_threshold_island = 0,
                area_threshold_mainland = 100, overlap_threshold = 0.1)
GIFT_no_overlap(c(10071, 12078), area_threshold_island = 0,
                area_threshold_mainland = 100000, overlap_threshold = 0.1)
```

<br>

## 5.2. By ref_ID
In `GIFT_checklists()`, there is also the possibility to remove overlapping
polygons only if they belong to the same reference (i.e. same `ref_ID`).  
<br>
We show how this works with the following example:  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ex <- GIFT_checklists(taxon_name = "Tracheophyta", by_ref_ID = FALSE,
                      list_set_only = TRUE)
ex2 <- GIFT_checklists(taxon_name = "Tracheophyta",
                       remove_overlap = TRUE, by_ref_ID = TRUE,
                       list_set_only = TRUE)
ex3 <- GIFT_checklists(taxon_name = "Tracheophyta",
                       remove_overlap = TRUE, by_ref_ID = FALSE,
                       list_set_only = TRUE)

length(unique(ex$lists$ref_ID))
length(unique(ex2$lists$ref_ID))
length(unique(ex3$lists$ref_ID))
```

Asking for checklists of vascular plants, we get 367 checklists without any
overlapping criterion, 335 if we remove overlapping polygons and 360 if we
remove overlapping polygons at the reference level.  
<br>
So what is the difference between the second and third case?  
Let's look at the checklists that are present in the second but not in the
third example.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
unique(ex2$lists$ref_ID)[!(unique(ex2$lists$ref_ID) %in%
                             unique(ex3$lists$ref_ID))] # 25 references
```

25 references are in the second and not in the third example.If we look at one
of the references listed `ref_ID = 10143`, we see that it is a checklist for
the Pilbara region in Australia. Its `entity_ID` is 10043. Looking at the GIFT
website, we see that other regions can overlap with it.  
<br>

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
pilbara <- GIFT_shapes(entity_ID = c(10043, 12172, 11398, 11391, 10918))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Pilbara region Australy and overlapping shapes
pilbara <- GIFT_shapes(entity_ID = c(10043, 12172, 11398, 11391, 10918))
```


```{r}
ggplot(pilbara) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = as.factor(entity_ID)), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_brewer("entity_ID", palette = "Set1")
```

Since these polygons do not belong to the same `ref_ID`, they are kept when
`by_ref_ID = TRUE` but are not considered when `by_ref_ID = FALSE`.

# 6. Species

All the plant species present in GIFT database can be retrieved using
`GIFT_species()`.  

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
species <- GIFT_species()
```

To add additional information, like their order or family,
we can call `GIFT_taxgroup()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Add Family
species$Family <- GIFT_taxgroup(
  as.numeric(species$work_ID), taxon_lvl = "family", return_ID = FALSE, 
  species = species)
```

Order or higher levels can also be retrieved.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
GIFT_taxgroup(as.numeric(species$work_ID[1:5]), taxon_lvl = "order",
              return_ID = FALSE)
GIFT_taxgroup(as.numeric(species$work_ID[1:5]),
              taxon_lvl = "higher_lvl", return_ID = FALSE,
              species = species)
```

<br>

As said above, plant species names can vary from the original sources they come
from to the final `work_species` name they get, due to the taxonomic
harmonization procedure. Looking-up for a species and the different steps of
the taxonomic harmonization is possible with the function
`GIFT_species_lookup()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Fagus <- GIFT_species_lookup(genus = "Fagus", epithet = "sylvatica",
                             namesmatched = TRUE)
```

In this table, we can see that the first entry *Fagus silvatica* was later
converted as the accepted name *Fagus sylvatica*.

<br>

# 7. Taxonomy

The taxonomy used in GIFT database can be downloaded using `GIFT_taxonomy()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
taxo <- GIFT_taxonomy()
```

<br>

# 8. Overlap_GloNAF tables (and others)

As other global databases of plant diversity exist and may rely on different
polygons, we provide a function `GIFT_overlap()` than can look at the spatial
overlap between GIFT polygons and polygons coming from other databases.
<br>
So far, only two resources are available: `glonaf` and `gmba`.
`glonaf` stands for [Global Naturalized Alien Flora](https://glonaf.org/) and
`gmba` for
[Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment](https://www.gmba.unibe.ch/).

`GIFT_overlap()` returns the spatial overlap in percentage for each pairwise
combination of polygons between GIFT and the other resource.

```{r}
glonaf <- GIFT_overlap(resource = "glonaf")

kable(glonaf[1:5, ], "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

gmba <- GIFT_overlap(resource = "gmba")

kable(gmba[1:5, ], "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
