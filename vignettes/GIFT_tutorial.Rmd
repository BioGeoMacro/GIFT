The Global Inventory of Floras and Traits (GIFT) is a database of floras and
plant checklists, distributed worldwide. It also includes trait and
phylogenetic information. The GIFT R package grants an access to the GIFT
database.
<br>
This vignette illustrates the most common usages of the package through
detailed examples.

1. Retrieving plant checklists within a given area (example: Mediterranean)  
2. Getting the distribution of a plant species  
3. Retrieving trait information for a subset of plant species  
4. Retrieving environmental information for a list of polygons/regions  

<br><br><br>

# 1. Checklists for a region
## 1.1. Shapefile
Let's assume we are interested in having a floristic knowledge of the western
part of the Mediterranean basin. For this purpose, we can simply use a
shapefile of the region of interest and feed it to the `GIFT_checklist()`
function.  

We do provide a shapefile of this region in the `GIFT` R package, which you
can access using the `data("med")` command.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
data("med")

world <- ne_coastline(returnclass = "sf")

eckertIV <-
  "+proj=eck4 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = med, fill = "darkblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.5,
          size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Western Mediterranean basin") +
  lims(x = c(-20, 20), y = c(24, 48)) +
  theme_void()
```

<br>
*Please note that the projection used in GIFT is the WGS84, and that all*
*shapefiles provided should be in this CRS. You can check the coordinate*
*reference system of a sf object by using* `sf::st_crs().`
<br>

## 1.2. Main arguments

Now that we have a shape for the region of interest, let's call
`GIFT_checklist()`. This wrapper function has many arguments which we detail
in this subsection.
<br>
First, the taxonomic group of interest. We can be interested in a particular
group of plants, for example only Angiosperms. In that case, we would set the
`taxon_name` argument like this `taxon_name = "Angiospermae"`. If we are
interested in a particular plant family, let's say orchids, then 
`taxon_name = "Orchidaceae"`.
<br>
To see all options for the `taxon_name` argument, you can run the
`GIFT_taxonomy()` function and look at the `taxon_name` column of its output.
<br>
Together with this first argument comes `complete_taxon`. This argument, set by
default to `TRUE` defines whether incomplete checklists **regarding the**
**taxon of interest** should be retrieved. Figure 1 is explaining the
principle.
<br><br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Complete taxon", out.width = "50%",echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_complete_taxon.png")
```
<br>
In Figure 1, we want to retrieve checklists of Angiosperms. In the first region
available, region A only one checklist is of interest. This checklist is then
always retrieved. In region B, there is only a checklist of orchids, which is
a subset only of Angiosperms. If `complete_taxon` is set to `FALSE`, then this
checklist won't be retrieved, otherwise yes. Finally, in region C, there is a
checklist of vascular plants and one for orchids. In both cases, the checklist
of vascular plants will be retrieved after filtering out the non-angiosperm
species. The species of Orchids is also retrieved in both cases as it is not
the only one available and as it can complete the floristic knowledge for
Angiosperms in this region.
<br>
<br>
Following arguments of `GIFT_checklist()` relate to the floristic statuses of
plant species. We can for example only be interested in endemic species, or
naturalized species. Default value is retrieving all native species.
<br>
Similarly, two arguments are needed in the function. First, `floristic_group`
defines the group of interest. Second, `complete_floristic` states whether
incomplete regions regarding the floristic group chosen should be retrieved or
not. The logic is detailed in Figure 2 and is similar to the `complete_taxon`
argument shown before.  

<br>
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Complete floristic", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_complete_floristic.png")
```
<br>

The next set of arguments relate to spatial matching between the desired area
and the GIFT database. 
<br>

The main argument in that regard, when providing a shapefile or a set of
coordinates, is the `overlap` argument. This argument can get 4 options, each
of these options leading to a different outcome as explained in Figure 3.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. GIFT spatial", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_spatial.png")
```
<br>

On Figure3, the GIFT polygons represented in orange either intersect, fall
inside or outside the provided shape file. The overlap argument below each GIFT
polygon illustrates in which situation a given GIFT polygon is retrieved or
not.

<br>

Another important spatial feature we provide is the possibility to remove
overlapping polygons. Indeed, for many regions in the world, there are several
polygons in GIFT database that cover them. Since you may not want overlapping
polygons. If you do not care about overlapping polygons, you can simply set
`remove_overlap` to FALSE.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. No overlap", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_no_overlap.png")
```
<br>

But in case you want one polygon per region, then `remove_overlap` can be set
to `TRUE`. In that case, the `GIFT_checklist()` will either retrieve the
smaller or the larger polygon. This will depend on the values set for the
argument `area_th_mainland` as detailed in Figure 4. This argument takes a
value in $km^2$. If the smaller polygon exceeds that threshold, then it will be
retrieved (right column of Figure 4). In case the area of the smaller polygon
is below the threshold, then the larger overlapping polygon will be retrieved
(middle column in Figure 4).  
There is a similar argument for islands, `area_th_island`, which is by default
set to 0 $km^2$. That way, by default, the smaller islands are always
retrieved.
<br>
Please also note that polygons are considered as overlapping when the exceed a
certain percentage of overlap. This percentage can be modified using the
`overlap_th` argument (Figure 5). This argument is set by default to 10%.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 5. Overlap threshold", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_overlap_th.png")
```
<br>

## 1.3. GIFT_checklist()

Now that we covered the main arguments of `GIFT_checklist()`, we can retrieve
plant checklists for the Mediterranean region. `GIFT_checklist()` returns a
list of two elements. First the metadata of checklists fulfilling the
different criteria. The second element is a `data.frame` of all the checklists
with the species composition per checklist.
<br>
If you only want to retrieve the metadata, you can set the argument
`list_set_only` to `TRUE`.
<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ex_meta <- GIFT_checklist(taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                          shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside",
                          list_set_only = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
medit <- GIFT_checklist(taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                        complete_taxon = TRUE,
                        floristic_group = "native",
                        complete_floristic = TRUE,
                        geo_type = "All",
                        shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside", 
                        remove_overlap = FALSE,
                        taxonomic_group = TRUE) # this argument adds two
# columns to the checklist: plant family and taxonomic group of each species
```

<br>

We can now have an estimation on the number of checklists with native
Angiosperm species in the western part of the Mediterranean basin, as well as
of the number of species.
<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Number of references covered
length(unique(medit[[2]]$ref_ID))
# Number of checklists covered (one reference can have several lists inside)
length(unique(medit[[2]]$list_ID))
# Number of species
length(unique(medit[[2]]$work_species))
```

<br>
You can now apply different values for the arguments detailed above. When being
stricter with some criteria, you can see that the number of checklists
retrieved decreases. For example, when removing overlapping regions:
<br>

```{r, message = FALSE}
medit_no_overlap <- GIFT_checklist(shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside",
                                   taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                                   remove_overlap = TRUE)

# Number of references covered
length(unique(medit[[2]]$ref_ID))
length(unique(medit_no_overlap[[2]]$ref_ID))
```

Please note that the function not only works with a shape file but can accept a
set of coordinates. The example below illustrates a case in which you want to
retrieve GIFT checklists intersecting the coordinates of Göttingen.
<br>

```{r}
custom_point <- cbind(9.9, 51) # coordinates of Göttingen

got <- GIFT_checklist(coordinates = custom_point,
                      overlap = "extent_intersect",
                      taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                      remove_overlap = TRUE,
                      list_set_only = TRUE)

kable(got[[1]], "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
<br><br>

To cite properly the references retrieved, you can run the function
`GIFT_references()` and look for the column `ref_long``. The column also
`geo_entity_ref` associates each reference to a name.

<br>

## 1.4. Species richness map

Once we downloaded a set of checklists, it is possible to map the species
richness of the taxonomic group of interest. For this purpose, we use a
combination of two functions: `GIFT_richness()` which either retrieves species
richness or trait coverage per polygon and `GIFT_shape()` which retrieves the
shapefile of a list of GIFT polygons.
<br>
The next two chunks illustrate this for the Angiosperms in the World and in the
Western part of the Mediterranean basin.
<br>

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
gift_shape <- GIFT_shape() # retrieves all shapefiles by default

angio_rich <- GIFT_richness(what = "species_richness",
                            taxon_name = "Angiospermae")

rich_map <- dplyr::left_join(gift_shape, angio_rich, by = "entity_ID") %>%
  dplyr::filter(stats::complete.cases(total))

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = rich_map, aes(fill = total + 1)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Species number\n(log-transformed)", trans = "log",
                       labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Angiosperms", subtitle = "Projection EckertIV") +
  coord_sf(crs = eckertIV) +
  theme_void()
```

<br>

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
med_shape <- gift_shape[which(gift_shape$entity_ID %in% 
                                unique(medit[[2]]$entity_ID)), ]

med_rich <- angio_rich[which(angio_rich$entity_ID %in% 
                               unique(medit[[2]]$entity_ID)), ]

med_map <- dplyr::left_join(med_shape, med_rich, by = "entity_ID") %>%
  dplyr::filter(stats::complete.cases(total))

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = med, fill = "darkblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.1,
          size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = med_map, aes(fill = total)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Species number") +
  labs(title = "Angiosperms in the Western Mediterranean basin") +
  lims(x = c(-20, 20), y = c(24, 48)) +
  theme_void()
```

<br><br>

# 2. Distribution of species

The GIFT R package also allows for retrieving the spatial distribution of a
focal plant species.
<br>

## 2.1. Available species
To know what plantspecies are available, you can first run the function
`GIFT_species()`.

```{r}
all_sp <- GIFT_species()
```

`r length(unique(all_sp$work_ID))` species are currently available in the
database. This number may increase with new releases of the database.

## 2.2. Species names and taxonomic harmonization

Since GIFT is a collection of checklists in which authors use their own
taxonomic knowledge to describe species, there is a step of taxonomic
harmonization when including checklists into the database. The most frequent
backbone used is the
[World Checklists of Vascular Plants (WCVP)](https://wcvp.science.kew.org/).
<br>
Both original and harmonized names are stored in the database and you can use
the function `GIFT_species_lookup()` to look at the differences for particular
species. For example, the evergreen oak *Quercus ilex*.
<br>

```{r fagus_lookup}
quercus_lookup <- GIFT_species_lookup(genus = "Quercus", epithet = "ilex")

kable(quercus_lookup, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

Looking at the output table, you can see the original species names and their
identification numbers (`name_ID`) **before** taxonomic harmonization. The
species' names and IDs **after** taxonmic harmonization are the last columns on
the right starting with the prefix `work_`.

<br><br>

## 2.3. Species distribution
<br>
Now that we have a focal species and its harmonized name, we can retrieve its
distribution using `GIFT_species_distribution()`.
<br>
Please note that we here set the `aggregation` argument to `TRUE` in order to
have only one floristic status per polygon. For further details, check the
help page of the function.
<br>

```{r}
quercus_distr <- GIFT_species_distribution(
  genus = "Quercus", epithet = "ilex", aggregation = TRUE)
```

<br>

Now that we know in which polygons the species occur, we can map its
distribution using the GIFT shapes we retrieved earlier using `GIFT_shape()`.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
quercus_shape <- gift_shape[which(gift_shape$entity_ID %in% 
                                    unique(quercus_distr$entity_ID)), ]

quercus_map <- dplyr::left_join(
  quercus_shape,
  quercus_distr[, c("entity_ID", "native", "naturalized", "endemic_list")],
  by = "entity_ID")

quercus_map <- tidyr::pivot_longer(
  quercus_map, cols = c("native", "naturalized", "endemic_list"),
  names_to = "Status", values_to = "status_value")

quercus_map <- quercus_map[which(quercus_map$status_value == 1), ]

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = quercus_map, aes(fill = as.factor(Status))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d("Status") +
  labs(title = expression(paste("Distribution map of ",
                                italic("Quercus ilex"))),
       subtitle = "Projection EckertIV") +
  coord_sf(crs = eckertIV) +
  theme_void()
```

<br><br>

# 3. Trait data

Trait information at the species level are also made available in the `GIFT` R
package.
<br>

## 3.1. Metadata
<br>
There are many functional traits available in GIFT. Each of these traits has
an identification number called `trait_ID`. As the two functions retrieving
trait values, `GIFT_traits()` and `GIFT_traits_raw()`, rely on these IDs, the
first step to do is to run the function `GIFT_traits_meta()` to know what is
the ID of the wanted trait.
<br>
For example, let's say we want to retrieve the maximal vegetative heights of
plant species.
<br>
```{r}
trait_meta <- GIFT_traits_meta()
trait_meta[which(trait_meta$Trait2 == "Plant_height_max"), ]
```
<br>
We can see that the ID of this trait is `1.6.2`. Now that we have the ID, we
can retrieve the growth form values of different plant species using
`GIFT_traits()`.

<br>

## 3.2. Trait values

There are two functions to access trait values. First, `GIFT_traits_raw()`
gives all the trait values for a given species and a given trait. These trait
values can then vary.
<br>
Second, `GIFT_traits()` returns an aggregated trait value at the species level.
The aggregation simply takes the mean for continuous traits or the most
frequent entry for categorical traits. However, for some specific cases, the
aggregation takes either the minimum or maximum, like for the trait we chose.
<br>
Let's 

```{r, message=FALSE}
height <- GIFT_traits(trait_IDs = c("1.6.2"), agreement = 0.66,
                      bias_ref = FALSE, bias_deriv = FALSE)

height_raw <- GIFT_traits_raw(trait_IDs = c("1.6.2"))

# Raw values
as.numeric(height_raw[which(height_raw$work_species == "Fagus sylvatica"),
                      "trait_value"])

# Aggregated value
as.numeric(height[which(height$work_species == "Fagus sylvatica"),
                  "trait_value_1.6.2"])
```

Three maximal heights for *Fagus sylvatica* were available, 30, 35 and 50
meters, which led to an aggregated value of 50 meters.

<br>

## 3.3. Trait coverage

We can also retrieve trait coverage information for polygons, using the same
function as for species richness `GIFT_richness()`.
<br>
In combination with the shapes loaded previously, we can also map the trait
coverage.
<br>

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
angio_height <- GIFT_richness(what = "trait_coverage",
                              taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                              trait_ID = "1.6.2")

angio_height_shape <- gift_shape[which(gift_shape$entity_ID %in% 
                                         unique(angio_height$entity_ID)), ]

angio_height_map <- dplyr::left_join(
  angio_height_shape, angio_height, by = "entity_ID")

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = angio_height_map[complete.cases(angio_height_map$native), ],
          aes(fill = native)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Coverage (%)") +
  labs(title = "Coverage for maximal vegetative height of Angiosperms",
       subtitle = "Projection EckertIV") +
  coord_sf(crs = eckertIV) +
  theme_void()
```

<br><br>

# 4. Environmental variables

Finally, a set of summary statistics for many environmental variables can be
retrieved for each GIFT polygon.

## 4.1. Metadata
We here illustrate how to retrieve environmental variables, summarized at the
polygon level, for a subset of polygons.
<br>
We here retrieve environmental variables for the polygons falling into the
western Mediterranean basin, retrieved in the section 1.
<br>
To know what variables are available, you can run these two metadata functions: `GIFT_env_meta_misc()` and `GIFT_env_meta_raster()`. They respectively give
access to the list of miscellaneous variables and raster layers available in
the GIFT database.
<br>
The references to cite when using environmental variables are also available
through these functions (column `ref_long` of the outputs).  
<br>
```{r env_meta}
misc_env <- GIFT_env_meta_misc()
raster_env <- GIFT_env_meta_raster()
```
<br>

## 4.2. Environmental values
Now, let's say we want to retrieve the perimeter and biome of each polygon as
well as elevation and mean temperature. For these two raster layers, we need to
define summary statistics, as the polygons are usually bigger than the raster
resolution.
<br>
They are many summary statistics available, you can check the help page of
`GIFT_env()` to see them all. Let's here call for the mean and median of
elevation and the maximal value of average temperature.
<br>
```{r}
med_env <- GIFT_env(entity_ID = unique(medit[[2]]$entity_ID),
                    miscellaneous = c("perimeter", "biome"),
                    rasterlayer = c("mn30_grd", "wc2.0_bio_30s_01"),
                    sumstat = list(c("mean", "med"), "max"))

med_env[1, ]
```

<br>

## 4.3. Map

Using the shapes previously loaded, we can also map a particular environmental
variable for all GIFT polygons.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
world_temp <- GIFT_env(entity_ID = unique(angio_rich$entity_ID),
                       rasterlayer = c("wc2.0_bio_30s_01"),
                       sumstat = c("mean"))
world_temp$entity_ID <- as.numeric(world_temp$entity_ID)

temp_shape <- gift_shape[which(gift_shape$entity_ID %in% 
                                 unique(angio_rich$entity_ID)), ]

temp_map <- dplyr::left_join(temp_shape, world_temp, by = "entity_ID")

temp_map$mean_wc2.0_bio_30s_01 <- as.numeric(temp_map$mean_wc2.0_bio_30s_01)

ggplot(world) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray50") +
  geom_sf(data = temp_map, aes(fill = mean_wc2.0_bio_30s_01)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Celsius degrees") +
  labs(title = "Average temperature",
       subtitle = "Projection EckertIV") +
  coord_sf(crs = eckertIV) +
  theme_void()
```
