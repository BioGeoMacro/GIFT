# 1. Overview

The GIFT R package grants an access to the Global Inventory of Floras and
Traits (GIFT) database. This vignette illustrates the most common usages of
the package through three detailed examples:

1. Retrieving plant checklists within a given area (example: Mediterranean)
2. Getting the distribution of a plant species
3. Retrieving trait information for a subset of plant species

\newpage

# 2. Checklists for a region

Let's assume we are interested in having a floristic knowledge of the
Mediterranean basin. For this purpose, we can simply use a shapefile of the
region of interest and feed it to the `GIFT_checklist()` function.  

We do provide a shapefile of this region in the `GIFT` R package, which you
can assess using the `data()` function.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
data("med")
plot(med, main = "Shape of Mediterranean\nregion")
```

Please note that the projection used in GIFT is the WGS84, and that all
shapefiles provided should be in this CRS. You can check this using
`sf::st_crs().`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sf::st_crs(med)
```

Now that we have a shape for the region of interest, let's call
`GIFT_checklist()`. This wrapper function has many arguments which we detail
here.
<br>
First, the taxonomic group of interest. We can be interested in a particular
group of plants, for example only Angiosperms. In that case, we would set the
`taxon_name` argument like this `taxon_name = "Angiospermae"`. If we are
interested in a particular plant family, let's say orchids, then 
`taxon_name = "Orchidaceae"`.
<br>
To see all options for the `taxon_name` argument, you can run the
`GIFT_taxonomy()` function and look at the `taxon_name` column of its output.
<br>
Together with this first argument comes `complete_taxon`. This argument, set by
default to `TRUE` defines whether incomplete checklists **regarding the**
**taxon of interest** should be retrieved. Figure 1 is explaining the
principle.
<br><br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Complete taxon", out.width = "50%",echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_complete_taxon.png")
```
<br>
In Figure 1, we want to retrieve checklists of Angiosperms. In the first region
available, region A only one checklist is of interest. This checklist is then
always retrieved. In region B, there is only a checklist of orchids, which is
a subset only of Angiosperms. If `complete_taxon` is set to `FALSE`, then this
checklist won't be retrieved, otherwise yes. Finally, in region C, there is a
checklist of vascular plants and one for orchids. In both cases, the checklist
of vascular plants will be retrieved after filtering out the non-angiosperm
species. The species of Orchids is also retrieved in both cases as it is not
the only one available and as it can complete the floristic knowledge for
Angiosperms in this region.
<br>
<br>
Following arguments of `GIFT_checklist()` relate to the floristic statuses of
plant species. We can for example only be interested in endemic species, or
naturalized species. Default value is retrieving all native species.
<br>
Similarly, two arguments are needed in the function. First, `floristic_group`
defines the group of interest. Second, `complete_floristic` states whether
incomplete regions regarding the floristic group chosen should be retrieved or
not. The logic is detailed in Figure 2 and is similar to the `complete_taxon`
argument shown before.  

<br>
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Complete floristic", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_complete_floristic.png")
```
<br>

The next set of arguments relate to spatial matching between the desired area
and the GIFT database. 
<br>

The main argument in that regard, when providing a shapefile or a set of
coordinates, is the `overlap` argument. This argument can get 4 options, each
of these options leading to a different outcome as explained in Figure 3.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3. GIFT spatial", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_spatial.png")
```
<br>

On Figure3, the GIFT polygons represented in orange either intersect, fall
inside or outside the provided shape file. The overlap argument below each GIFT
polygon illustrates in which situation a given GIFT polygon is retrieved or
not.

<br>

Another important spatial feature we provide is the possibility to remove
overlapping polygons. Indeed, for many regions in the world, there are several
polygons in GIFT database that cover them. Since you may not want overlapping
polygons. If you do not care about overlapping polygons, you can simply set
`remove_overlap` to FALSE.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4. No overlap", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_no_overlap.png")
```
<br>

But in case you want one polygon per region, then `remove_overlap` can be set
to `TRUE`. In that case, the `GIFT_checklist()` will either retrieve the
smaller or the larger polygon. This will depend on the values set for the
argument `area_th_mainland` as detailed in Figure 4. This argument takes a
value in $km^2$. If the smaller polygon exceeds that threshold, then it will be
retrieved (right column of Figure 4). In case the area of the smaller polygon
is below the threshold, then the larger overlapping polygon will be retrieved
(middle column in Figure 4).  
There is a similar argument for islands, `area_th_island`, which is by default
set to 0 $km^2$. That way, by default, the smaller islands are always
retrieved.
<br>
Please also note that polygons are considered as overlapping when the exceed a
certain percentage of overlap. This percentage can be modified using the
`overlap_th` argument (Figure 5). This argument is set by default to 10%.
<br>

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 5. Overlap threshold", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/GIFT_overlap_th.png")
```
<br>

Now that we covered the main arguments of `GIFT_checklist()`, we can retrieve
plant checklists for the Mediterranean region. `GIFT_checklist()` returns a
list of two elements. First the metadata of checklists fulfilling the
different criteria. The second element is a `data.frame` of all the checklists
with the species composition per checklist.
<br>
If you only want to retrieve the metadata, you can set the argument
`list_set_only` to `TRUE`.
<br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ex_meta <- GIFT_checklist(taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                          shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside",
                          list_set_only = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
medit <- GIFT_checklist(taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                        complete_taxon = TRUE,
                        floristic_group = "native",
                        complete_floristic = TRUE,
                        geo_type = "All",
                        shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside", 
                        remove_overlap = FALSE,
                        taxonomic_group = TRUE) # this argument adds two columns
# to the checklist: plant family and taxonomic group of each species
```

<br>

We can now have an estimation on the number of checklists with native
Angiosperm species in the Mediterranean basin, as well as of the number of
species.
<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Number of references covered
length(unique(medit[[2]]$ref_ID))
# Number of checklists covered (one reference can have several lists inside)
length(unique(medit[[2]]$list_ID))
# Number of species
length(unique(medit[[2]]$work_species))
```

<br>
You can now apply different values for the arguments detailed above. When being
stricter with some criteria, you can see that the number of checklists
retrieved decreases. For example, when removing overlapping regions:
<br>

```{r}
medit_no_overlap <- GIFT_checklist(shp = med, overlap = "centroid_inside",
                                   taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                                   remove_overlap = TRUE)

# Number of references covered
length(unique(medit[[2]]$ref_ID))
length(unique(medit_no_overlap[[2]]$ref_ID))
```

Please note that the function not only works with a shape file but can accept a
set of coordinates. The example below illustrates a case in which you want to
retrieve GIFT checklists intersecting the coordinates of Göttingen.
<br>

```{r}
custom_point <- cbind(9.9, 51) # coordinates of Göttingen

got <- GIFT_checklist(coordinates = custom_point,
                      overlap = "extent_intersect",
                      taxon_name = "Angiospermae",
                      remove_overlap = TRUE,
                      list_set_only = TRUE)

got[[1]]
```
<br><br>
<br><br>

Making maps using `GIFT_richness()` (SR + trait coverage).
<br>

# 3. Distribution of species
`GIFT_species()`

`GIFT_species_lookup()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```

<br><br>
Also, plot species richness.
<br>

<br><br>

# 4. Trait data

Raw traits, and traits after taxonomic harmonization.

`GIFT_traits_meta()`, `GIFT_traits_raw()`, `GIFT_traits()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wood <- GIFT_traits(trait_IDs = c("1.1.1", "1.2.1"), agreement = 0.66,
                    bias_ref = FALSE, bias_deriv = FALSE)

succulence_carnivory <- GIFT_traits_raw(trait_IDs = c("4.10.1", "4.16.1"))


ex <- GIFT_traits_meta()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```

<br>
Also, plot trait coverage.
<br>

<br><br>

# 5. Environmental values
`GIFT_env()`, `GIFT_env_meta_misc()`, `GIFT_env_meta_raster()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
misc_env <- GIFT_env_meta_misc()
raster_env <- GIFT_env_meta_raster()

ex_env <- GIFT_env(entity_ID = c(1,5),
               miscellaneous = c("perimeter", "biome"),
               rasterlayer = c("mn30_grd", "wc2.0_bio_30s_01"),
               sumstat = list(c("mean", "med"), "max"))
```
